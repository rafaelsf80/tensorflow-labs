# TensorFlow labs

Notebooks and scripts to prepare the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate), as well as other samples covering more content.

> This repo contains some exercises to be completed. In some files, code may contain some `TODO` to be completed/filled. The solution is not included in this repo.
